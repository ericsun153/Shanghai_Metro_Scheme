Our project aims to create a scrollytelling website that tells the story of the historical development of the Shanghai Metro's layout. We will take a historical perspective to explore the principles that have guided the planning of the Shanghai Metro, as well as the adaptive changes and decisions made in urban planning.

To achieve this, we will delve into the data behind the metro's planning, including passenger flow and service frequency. By analyzing this data, we will uncover the specific reasons behind the metro's planning and gain insights into how it has evolved over time.
Furthermore, we will use our findings to predict how the metro will develop in the future. This will involve considering various factors, such as population growth, urbanization, and technological advancements.

Overall, our project will provide a comprehensive and engaging exploration of the Shanghai Metro's development, offering valuable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and anyone interested in the evolution of this vital transportation system.

## 1. What have you done so far?
In the initial stages of our project, we've taken significant strides towards creating an interactive and engaging web experience centered around the evolution of the Shanghai Metro. Our efforts commenced with the integration of Mapbox, a powerful tool that enables us to incorporate detailed maps into our web page. This decision was pivotal, as it allowed us to create a visually rich backdrop that complements the narrative we aim to convey. The core of our project is a scrolltelling experience, meticulously designed to guide users through the chronological development of the metro system. As visitors navigate through the webpage, they're introduced to each metro line one by one. For each line, we provide not only the essential details such as the year of establishment and route information but also delve into its historical significance and the impact it has had on the city's development. This narrative culminates in a comprehensive diagram of the entire metro system, offering users a holistic view and enabling in-depth analysis. This phase of the project required careful planning and execution, ensuring that the storytelling aspect seamlessly blends with the interactive map elements to create an immersive user experience.

## 2. What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?
One of the most formidable tasks we've encountered was the process of data cleaning. The dataset we initially acquired was laden with extraneous information, presenting a significant obstacle to our progress. To address this, we developed a specialized script designed to sift through the data, discarding irrelevant details and organizing the remaining information in a manner that would be conducive to our project's goals. This step was critical in ensuring that we could accurately represent each metro line's history and details without overwhelming users with unnecessary data. Furthermore, another major challenge lay in the design of the webpage layout itself. Our ambition was to create a webpage that not only informed but also captivated our audience from the outset. We envisioned an introductory section that would draw users in with a striking static image, before transitioning into the dynamic map of Shanghai, where each metro line would be highlighted in sequence. Achieving this vision required a substantial amount of time and effort, particularly in refining the page format to facilitate a smooth and engaging transition between the static and interactive elements. This aspect of the project demanded a deep understanding of both web design principles and the technical capabilities of the tools at our disposal, making it one of the most challenging yet rewarding parts of our work.
