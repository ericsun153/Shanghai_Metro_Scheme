Our project aims to create a scrollytelling website that tells the story of the historical development of the Shanghai Metro's layout. We will take a historical perspective to explore the principles that have guided the planning of the Shanghai Metro, as well as the adaptive changes and decisions made in urban planning.

To achieve this, we will delve into the data behind the metro's planning, including passenger flow and service frequency. By analyzing this data, we will uncover the specific reasons behind the metro's planning and gain insights into how it has evolved over time.
Furthermore, we will use our findings to predict how the metro will develop in the future. This will involve considering various factors, such as population growth, urbanization, and technological advancements.

Overall, our project will provide a comprehensive and engaging exploration of the Shanghai Metro's development, offering valuable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and anyone interested in the evolution of this vital transportation system.

## 1. What have you done so far?
So far, we have developed the foundational structure of our project, incorporating Mapbox to serve as the backdrop for our entire page. At the heart of our project lies a scrolltelling webpage that narrates the comprehensive history of the Shanghai Metro. As users scroll through the page, each new metro line is introduced, accompanied by essential information and its historical context. Upon discussing each line individually, a complete diagram is presented, enabling further analysis.

## 2. What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?
One significant challenge we encountered was the data-cleaning process required for our project. The initial dataset was cluttered with irrelevant information, necessitating the development of a script to reformat the data and extract pertinent details effectively. Another major hurdle was designing the layout of the overall page. Our vision included an introductory section paired with a static image, followed by a dynamic transition to a map of Shanghai as the backdrop, showcasing each metro line in sequence. Consequently, a considerable amount of time was devoted to adjusting the page format to realize this concept.
