## 1. What have you done so far?
So far, we have developed the foundational structure of our project, incorporating Mapbox to serve as the backdrop for our entire page. At the heart of our project lies a scrolltelling webpage that narrates the comprehensive history of the Shanghai Metro. As users scroll through the page, each new metro line is introduced, accompanied by essential information and its historical context. Upon discussing each line individually, a complete diagram is presented, enabling further analysis.

## 2. What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?
One significant challenge we encountered was the data-cleaning process required for our project. The initial dataset was cluttered with irrelevant information, necessitating the development of a script to reformat the data and extract pertinent details effectively. Another major hurdle was designing the layout of the overall page. Our vision included an introductory section paired with a static image, followed by a dynamic transition to a map of Shanghai as the backdrop, showcasing each metro line in sequence. Consequently, a considerable amount of time was devoted to adjusting the page format to realize this concept.
